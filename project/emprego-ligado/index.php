				<p class="description">Emprego Ligado is a Brazilian start-up connecting employers and potential employees through the web and SMS. I designed a clean, intuitive interface catered to users of all technical backgrounds, streamlining the experience to make it easy for potential employees to sign up and create a profile. The employer dashboard was designed for easy management of potential candidates and optimized communication through SMS, which was powered by the web application. Back-end development of this application was handled by my friends at bxCreative.</p>

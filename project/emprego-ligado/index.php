				<p class="description">Emprego Ligado is a Brazilian start-up connecting employers and potential employees through the web and SMS. I designed a clean, intuitive interface for users of all technical backgrounds, streamlining the experience to make it easy for potential employees to sign up and create a profile. The employer dashboard was designed to easily manage potential candidates and optimize communication through SMS powered by the web application. Back-End development of this application was handled by my friends at <a href="http://bxcreative.com" target="_blank">bxCreative</a>.</p>

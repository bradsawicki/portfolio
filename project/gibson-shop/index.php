				<p class="description">The Gibson Shop deals Gibson guitars online and is the sister company of The Fender Reissue Shop. After I completed work on the Fender Reissue Shopâ€™s site, they came to me in need of branding and a new site for The Gibson Shop that would allow for easy inventory management. To achieve this, Drupal was used for content management, giving them complete control of their site.</p>

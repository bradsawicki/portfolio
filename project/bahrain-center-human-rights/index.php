				<p class="description">Bahrain Center for Human Rights is an organization defending and promoting human rights in Bahrain. Having years of posts in need of migration to a new system, this presented a challenge in redefining the presentation of the old content with the new interface and design. Like most news sites there is a strong focus on content, so some critical typography decision were made; increase the font size and leading, use condensed headlines to accomodate the longer article titles. This made for a optimal reading experience for users. Another huge challenge was designing an interface that solved the needs for both the english and arabic version of the site. Again, the focus on content made the interface for multi-lingual users optimal, while keeping the core design aesthetics.</p>

				<p class="description">The Everygirl is a resource for women’s lifestyle and inspiration. They approached the Eleven Eleven Creative team in need of a complete redesign of their site, new logo and migration of years of articles to a new system. The team collaborated to create a user experience focused on content, photography and social media interaction. Considering the extensive navigation and categories, engaging the user to find and read content of their interests was a challenge. Our solution: a mega drop down with sub categories and featured content, related articles at the end of each post, and a fixed “Next Article” block upon scroll for desktop users. As the front-end developer for this project, I utilized SASS to organize the large scale modular interface.</p>

				<p class="description">The Everygirl is a resource for women’s lifestyle and inspiration. They approached the Eleven Eleven Creative team in need of a complete website redesign, a new logo and the migration of years of articles to a new system. The team collaborated to create a user experience that is focused on content, photography and social media interaction. With sprawling navigation and numerous content categories, finding a way to engage users and allow them to easily find and read content of interest was a challenge. Our solution: a mega drop down with sub categories and featured content, links to related articles at the end of each post and a fixed “Next Article” block upon scroll for desktop users. As the front-end developer for this project, I utilized SASS to organize the large scale modular interface.</p>

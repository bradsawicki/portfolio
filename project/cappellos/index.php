				<p class="description">Cappelo's is a gluten free pasta company located in Denver. Their brand serves a certain attitude and edge that their website needed to embrace. Drupal is used as the core CMS and the Commerce module for online sales. The site navigation is powered by AJAX, while still maintaining a unique URL structure. The e-commerce and AJAX navigation was developed in partnership with our good friends at <a href="" target="_blank">bxCreative</a>.</p>

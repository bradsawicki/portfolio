			<h1 class="title">Cappello's Gluten Free</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p class="description">Cappello's is a gluten free / grain free company located in Denver. The initial design of the site aimed to express their unique and edgey brand, but as online sales began to increase, a focus on creating a user friendly purchasing experience emerged. In the fall of 2013, I completely updated the sites interface and design, positioning their products directly on the home page and giving users easy access to important food information on their products pages. In partnership with our good friends at <a href="" target="_blank">bxCreative</a>, we used the Drupal Commerce module to streamline UPS shipping integration and provide Cappello's easy management of shipping and sales data.</p>

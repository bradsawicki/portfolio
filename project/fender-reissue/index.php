				<p class="description">The Fender Reissue Shop deals Fender and Gretch guitars. They are the sister company of The Gibson Shop. Being one of my first freelance projects and a guitarist, this was an exciting project to be apart of. To embrace the vintage Fender vibe in the design, I utilized the textures from the classic tweed guitar case. Inventory updates and content management are powered by Drupal.</p>

				<p class="description">Argos Law is a boutique law firm in Chicago. Law firm websites and their users follow some fairly strict rules and Argos Law needed a site that kept within the rules, while still promoting a friendly future modern design and interface.  Considering the target audience is on the the go, an adaptive site for all devices was of great importance. The interface was designed in browser and tested on different devices to fine tune itâ€™s responsive design. The result is a beautiful interface for desktop, tablet and mobile users.</p>
